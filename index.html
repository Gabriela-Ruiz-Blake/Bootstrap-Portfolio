                  Gabriela Ruiz-Blake was born in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.
                  Growing up in a bicultural family with deep roots across the
                  world, she developed a global view at a young age. At 14 years
                  old she began her outreach work in many developing nations.
                  Her work with underserved immigrant communities in the United
                  States has allowed her to witness firsthand the importance of
                  access to financial and health systems. This understanding was
                  then intensified when she studied microeconomics in Bangladesh
                  and learned that, with free healthcare for women, families can
                  dig themselves out of the poverty trap. Her work in micro
                  insurance in Puerto Rico helped her understand the importance
                  of environmental protection. In 2017, she graduated from
                  Sewanee: The University of the South with a degree in
                  economics. After college she returned to Mallorca and has been
                  working with the Mallorca Womenâ€™s March to help activate
                  expats and help them engage with local and international
                  politics.
