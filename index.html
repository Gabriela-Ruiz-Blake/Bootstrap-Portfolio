                Gabriela Ruiz-Blake was born in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.
                Growing up in a bicultural family with deep roots across the
                world, she developed a global view at a young age. At 14 years
                old she began her outreach work in many developing nations. Her
                work with underserved immigrant communities in the United States
                has allowed her to witness firsthand the importance of access to
                financial and health systems. This understanding was then
                intensified when she studied microeconomics in Bangladesh and
                learned that, with free healthcare for women, families can dig
                themselves out of the poverty trap. Her work in micro insurance
                in Puerto Rico helped her understand the importance of
                environmental protection. In 2017, she graduated from Sewanee:
                The University of the South with a degree in economics. After
                college she returned to Mallorca and has been working with the
                Mallorca Womenâ€™s March to help activate expats and help them
                engage with local and international politics.
